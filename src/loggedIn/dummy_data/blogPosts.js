      Main Online Business Strategies – Ideas for Making Money Online
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      1. SAAS Business
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Software As A Service is simply building a website and providing a service
      that is sold on a monthly basis. So, you are selling memberships which is
      a great way to make money online. For example, Netflix is considered a
      SAAS business that you subscribe to monthly to watch movies.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      2. Freelancing
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      It is when you provide or sell your skills (Gigs) online. For example, if
      you are a graphic/logo designer you can provide your skills and sell them
      online.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      All you have to do is create a profile and publish your “Gigs” or services
      on freelancing websites. These websites include Fiverr, upwork,
      freelancer.com or else. Such website are grand freelancing websites, so
      they offer great opportunities to earn money online.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      3. Affiliate Marketing
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you are following my channel, you know I talk a lot about affiliates.
      It is one of the best strategies to make money online and work from home.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Simply, affiliate marketing is promoting affiliate products and services
      for other companies or people. When you promote an affiliate product,
      you'll earn a commission per sale or maybe sometimes per lead, action,
      sign up…
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      4. Content Creation
    </Typography>
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7844539134729812"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This means that you will create content like for example a blog and you
      publish articles. You may also create a YouTube channel and publish
      videos. Another option is creating an Instagram account and publishing
      content on it, whatever type of content and you monetize it.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Monetizing something means to make money from the content you share. For
      instance, you can publish ads on YouTube videos or publish ads on your
      Facebook page. Maybe you can sell your services through your blog, promote
      them, or even provide shout-outs to other services…
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      5. Online Stores
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Creating an online shop and selling products, that can be physical or
      digital, is one of the ideas for making money online.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      What I mean by digital is like selling eBooks, online courses, designs, or
      logos. Whatever you are selling, you can sell digital products in an
      online store.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      By physical products, it can be mobile phones, maybe your DIY stuff,
      flowers, whatever you want.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      So, these are the 5 main strategies that almost 99% of people who are
      successful and working online went through.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Applying the 5 Ideas for Making Money Online in My Business:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Let us see now how I applied all these strategies in my online business
      and how I connect things together.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      When you go on my website, the first things you'll see are the main
      heading, title, menu, email Sign Up box, and the main navigation. So, a
      simple, clean, and straight-to-the-point website.

      />
    </Grid>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Main Website (Main Heading – Title – Menu – Email Sign Up Box)
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you land on my website and ask yourself “What is H-educate about?”,
      four main features will get your attention:
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Main Heading
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      You will see in the main heading that it says that the website is all
      about online business, digital marketing and educational tips about new
      skills that will help you grow in your business.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Subscription Box
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The big box with which anyone can use to subscribe to my newsletter. Email
      marketing is very important if you have a business online or offline.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you are not building an email list, then you are losing a lot of
      customers, traffic, and clients. I am using ConvertKit for my private
      email list. You can see that today I have only 4 thousand subscribers
      although I'm receiving 264 thousand visits monthly. This is because I keep
      my list very active to keep a high open rate and click rate.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Menu
    </Typography>
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7844539134729812"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Through this big, simple, and attractive menu, I can point people to my
      other services. This means that I'm connecting my online businesses,
      websites, and services together. I will post on my YouTube channel how I
      created my website step by step so don’t worry about it. This is an
      indirect idea for making money online.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Main Menu
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      You can see that I am again pointing to all my other services like my
      academy, my blog, my service website, my eBooks, my SAAS services, and the
      giveaway page.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The idea here is that on my main home page, anyone can know what this
      website is about. Anyone can subscribe to my email list, so I can build my
      email list. Additionally, anyone can navigate through the menu or reach
      any of my services and other websites from the main menu.

      The website is like a navigational map to all of my businesses.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      1. Academy
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I built my academy with thinkific. If anyone clicks on my academy, they
      will be redirected to where I'm selling my online courses. An online
      academy is a form of a Digital Store that helps to make money online.

    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you go to my blog, you will find articles, tutorials, something
      valuable that people will love to read and implement. Something that will
      help people.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      On my blog, you will see that I am linking to my main website and other
      websites. I am promoting my online courses, my other paid services and my
      other websites as well as affiliate marketing.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you open for instance any article, let's say one that explains how to
      install an SMTP server. in the image below, You can also see many links
      inside this article. These are affiliate links that anyone can use to buy
      an affiliate product, and I will earn a commission. This means that you
      can earn money online with affiliate links.

    <Typography paragraph>
      I am using CJ.com to check the numbers I am getting thanks to the
      commissions.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I am connecting everything together by posting all of my websites' links
      in my blog. It is dynamic because let’s say you are promoting only the
      blog, the blog itself will promote the other websites.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      3. SAAS Business Models
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you go to my links “by h-educate”, you will have a list of services. In

      4. Freelancing
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Back to my main website, if you click on services link, it will redirect
      you to my services website on which I provide my Gigs (services). I have a
      total of 6 services now, and will have more soon. So, here on this
      website, I provide my freelancing services. This means that I sell my gigs
      for the purpose of benefitting people and making money online.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      5. Affiliate Marketing
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      You can go to my YouTube channel and check my videos. I have multiple
      affiliate marketing case studies and tutorial videos. Like I said before,
      it is all about promoting products for other people, for other services.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      How Do I Do It? Applying the ideas for making money online in my business.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      1. On my main website –
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I have a list of recommended services and all of them are affiliate links.
      So, if anyone goes to my website, checks my recommended services, and buys
      them, I will get a commission. It is a very basic form of affiliate
      promotion; it is monetizing the traffic with affiliate links.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      2. I promote through my YouTube channel.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In any of my videos, in the description, I share a lot of affiliate links.
      Also, if you check my channel's main page, you can see I am linking to my
      website.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      3. I include affiliate links on my blog.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I am also linking inside the articles and tutorials of my blog. Affiliate
      marketing is a great idea for making money online. Want to start an
      affiliate marketing business? Read this full tutorial on how to start from
      the beginning.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      4. I benefit from the forum that I created.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      My forums are very important to the business because I can organize
      support and make people talk to each other. It is a User Generated
      Marketing Technique. This means that people will publish on the forum;
      they will ask each other and will answer questions.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Of course, my team and I are doing a hard job to answer questions almost
      every day to give the forum a push. Now you may ask: how is this an idea
      for making money online?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In the forum, you will find affiliate banners and ads. So, I use the forum
      to generate traffic to my website and to promote affiliate products which
      result in me earning more.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Another advantage of having a forum is simply getting more organic views.
      When people go to a topic and start asking questions, they are writing
      what’s on their minds. When someone opens Google to search for something,
      they write what’s on their mind. Another advantage is that you will know
      what the audience wants, what type of content or topic they want.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      5. I sell my gigs on my services website.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The services website that I run is a platform to sell my gigs and my
      services. As we mentioned before, one of the ideas for making money online
      is to sell products. Here we are selling digital products.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I prefer to use my main website. That is simply because I already built my
      audience, therefore I don’t need to publish on other websites.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      6. My eBooks' page:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      You will find on my main website my eBooks' page, in it, I list my own
      eBooks. I wrote for example “The Power of Emails”, which is one of the
      best Email Marketing eBooks.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Moreover, on this page, you can see my recommended eBooks. I added some
      eBooks, and the links are from the Amazon affiliate program. Accordingly,
      anyone who buys any of these books from my website leads me to earn a
      commission from Amazon, which is one idea for making money online. As an
      example, in one of the books, I have this link that will take you to my
      other website that is called “Books and more”.blog. There, I publish book
      summaries where anyone can read a book in like 10 minutes.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      7. I include advertisements on my SEO and digital marketing website
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you click on “by H-educate”, you will see a list of other services and
      small free tools. Anyone can download them, and they help in digital
      marketing and email marketing.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      We can see then “H-supertools”, my number one platform and if you click on
      it; it will redirect to a platform. This is a free SEO and digital
      marketing platform website. It is not a script, I developed this from
      scratch. It is like a SAAS service but free, and I make money off of it
      thanks to the advertisements and the ads with Google AdSense. I advertised
      with Ezoic. I used it to monetize H-supertools which gave me a push in my
      revenue. With Google AdSense, I used to make 20 to 30 dollars per day.
      However, with Ezoic I’m making 40 to 65 dollars. So, I boosted the revenue
      by using Ezoic on my website.
    </Typography>
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7844539134729812"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Ezoic is a service that will scan your website and check the best places
      to place your ad. It will also choose the best ads for your website and
      for your audience to give you the best revenue.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      8. I sell ad spaces on my H-SuperTools website
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      One of the ideas for making money online is selling ad spaces. I run some
      private ads and sell ad spaces. The services I sell are like promoting
      your business or whatever you want on my websites. I publish an ad on my
      websites which gets traffic like 162 thousand views per month. So, I
      utilize everything, my ad spaces, my websites, and my menu to link
      everything together. So, on this website, I monetize with ads and with
      affiliate links.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you go to the affiliate programs section, you will see that I help
      affiliate marketers to select a service. But, all these links are
      affiliate links. So, if anyone clicks on the link and signs up, I will get
      a commission. Therefore, I am helping affiliate marketers and at the same
      time I earn commissions because we have the cookie policy. If someone
      clicks today, I will still earn money even if he signs up after the next
      year. This is the power of affiliate marketing!
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      And again, you can see that I am linking back to the giveaways on my main
      website. Moreover, I am also linking to the forum, to my blog, and so on.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Final Note
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Recently, I started 3 new SAAS businesses, biourl.com, H-socialproof.com,
      and H-analytics.com. I didn’t publish all these services yet which means
      you can’t subscribe now; for now, I am selling them privately.

  <Fragment>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In the past, online transactions used to be very difficult especially for
      the young people who do not have bank accounts because most of the online
      transactions require the use of credit cards or other payment methods like
      which also require a credit card to be linked to them&nbsp; in order for
      the transaction to be possible.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I personally used to face challenges while trying to get free trials on
      some sites for example I liked using digital ocean for cloud computing but
      to get their free trial, you need to first provide your credit card
      information so this was the challenge I used to face as many other people
      do because I had no knowledge about virtual credit cards but since I found
      them and started using them, everything has been easy for me and so can be
      easy for you after getting the information I'm about to show you below.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Importance of using virtual credit cards
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Virtual credit cards can help you to stay safe especially if you don't
      trust some site but you would like to get something like a free trial from
      them.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The reason why this is possible is because after using your virtual credit
      card, you can choose to cancel it at any time then the next time you want
      to do some other online transaction you can just get a new card and
      continue with your transaction without any worry.

    <Typography paragraph>
      As always you may have some feeling of unsafety especially after using
      your card to pay at a site that you do not trust very well or after
      getting a free trial and you do not want to be charged automatically after
      the trial ends so for that reason you may want to delete or cancel your
      Airtel Mastercard.

    <Typography paragraph>Hello and welcome back to JCP - Blog.</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In today's tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can fix this common
      issue of losing internet connection on your Lycamobile SIM card even if
      you have a good network signal and you still have data.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I understand it is so frustrating when you have just bought your data
      bundle but you are unable to access the internet even when you have a good
      network signal.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Why this happens?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The reason why this happens is very simple. It is just because lycamobile
      SIM cards do not come with a pre-defined access point out of the box.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      For that reason your sim card will not be able to automatically connect to
      the internet if your phone doesn't have the feature to automatically
      configure APN settings every time you turn on your data connection.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In case you don't know what APN is, Access Point Name is and network
      feature that helps your phone to connect to your internet service
      provider's server.
    </Typography>
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7844539134729812"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Access Point Names have a lot of features, for example you can configure
      your access point names to use proxy servers and this can help you to
      increase your security online and in some cases provide free internet.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      How to fix Lycamobile data bars.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Since you have known the reason that causes this problem, then fixing it
      won't be a lot hard.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>Follow the steps below to fix the issue.</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Please note that the guide provided below is just a general guide because
      different phone types have different versions and from different
      manufacturers and therefore will not have the exact set of procedure as
      this one but I'm sure it will just be related, so follow this as you
      integrate with what may be possible with your device.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      First open your phone settings and go to Wi-Fi and internet then select
      mobile networks.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      No you have to look for access point names but before that, make sure that
      it's your Lycamobile SIM card that you have selected.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Now what you have to know is that in some devices you may need to first
      click on the advanced tab in order to see the access point name settings..
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      All you have to do now is to create a new access point name give the name
      as LycaMobile and the access point as internet.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      That's all you have to do then save it and you will now be able to access
      the internet..

    <Typography paragraph>
      In the past, online transactions used to be very difficult especially for
      the young people who do not have bank accounts because most of the online
      transactions require the use of credit cards or other payment methods like
      PayPal which also require a credit card to be linked to them&nbsp; in
      order for the transaction to be possible.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I personally used to face challenges while trying to get free trials on
      some sites for example I liked using digital ocean for cloud computing but
      to get their free trial, you need to first provide your credit card
      information so this was the challenge I used to face as many other people
      do because I had no knowledge about virtual credit cards but since I found
      them and started using them, everything has been easy for me and so can be
      easy for you after getting the information I'm about to show you below.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Importance of using virtual credit cards
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Virtual credit cards can help you to stay safe especially if you don't
      trust some site but you would like to get something like a free trial from
      them.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The reason why this is possible is because after using your virtual credit
      card, you can choose to cancel it at any time then the next time you want
      to do some other online transaction you can just get a new card and
      continue with your transaction without any worry.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      As the main to purpose of this post is to show you how to get an MTN Momo
      Card, let's jump into the steps you need to take in order to get the card
      right away.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Keeping this in mind, MTN Momo cards are not free!
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The cost of an MTN normal card is 1,000 Ugandan shillings and expires
      after one month, that's if its not cancelled.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If you want a card that lasts longer and it's free then you have to opt in
      for the Airtel Mastercard.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Once you have the required 1000 UGX on your mobile money account to
      activate this MTN virtual master card, just follow the steps as described
      below.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>

      After doing that, the master card will be given to you immediately.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      To check your master card number later just dial *165*70# again and then
      select view card number, then confirm with your mobile money pin and then

      trading strategies? You can try betting with the draftkings sportsbook

    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In 2021 we’re lucky enough to have the world of football at our
      fingertips. As a result, it’s never been easier to bet on the sport we
      love yet most punters still haemorrhage their money away. I’ve been there.
      Believe me. Don’t fear though because over the years I’ve put plenty of
      research into beating the system and here I’m going to give you the five
      best football betting strategies to help turn you a profit.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      A betting strategy (also known as betting system) is a structured approach
      to gambling, in the attempt to produce a profit. To be successful, the
      system must change the house edge into a player advantage — which is
      impossible for pure games of probability with fixed odds, akin to a
      perpetual motion machine.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      How are football trading strategies different to normal betting?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph></Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The core difference between being a regular bettor and following a trading
      strategy is simply the fact that the strategic approach tends to follow a
      consistent set of rules. This approach won’t generally tee you up for a
      one off payday but, over an extended period, you should be winning on a
      more consistent basis. That’s the logic at least.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Of course, you might be reading this thinking ‘I did follow the same set
      of rules’. Maybe you did, maybe you had a strategy. Perhaps it just wasn’t
      a good one. Don’t worry though, we’ve got a few of the best and most
      trusted football trading strategies for you to cast your eyes over – and
      one to avoid!
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      7. Goliath Bets
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Are Goliath bets guaranteed to make you money? No but your odds of making
      a profit are greatly improved.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Traditionally, a Goliath bet is based off eight selections – let’s call it
      eight teams to win. Usually in this scenario you’d end up with an
      eight-fold accumulator but by using the Goliath option your bet is broken
      down into 247 different outcomes. These 247 selections cover every
      possible combination from doubles up to an eight-fold win. As such, your
      stake is multiplied so a 10p stake will actually cost you £24.70.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Although that’s a dramatic ramp up of stake, just two selections coming in
      will see you with some winnings (not necessarily profit) even though six
      of your eight selection were wrong. The more of your selections you get
      right, the more you win and the returns can be huge. It’s this final point
      why your football knowledge and research is still vital.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      6. Arbitrage betting
    </Typography>
    <Grid item>
      <ZoomImage
        style={{
          marginBottom: "10px",
          maxWidth: "100%",
          width: "100%",
          verticalAlign: "middle",
        }}
        src={
          "https://us.123rf.com/450wm/markoaliaksandr/markoaliaksandr2102/markoaliaksandr210200005/163500701-online-sports-betting-dollars-are-falling-on-the-background-of-a-hand-with-a-smartphone-and-a-soccer.jpg?ver=6"
        }
        alt="blog"
      />
    </Grid>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Arbitrage betting is probably something you’ve heard of but perhaps never
      believed to be viable. Let me assure you that it is completely viable.
      You’ll be turning a profit in no time. Arbitrage betting is all focused on
      exploiting the variation in odds across different bookmakers. Each bookie
      applies their own statistical approach to setting odds for an event.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      As a result, you will occasionally find games where both outcomes are
      priced in a manner that promises a profit – regardless of who wins. Let’s
      look at a draw no bet example from the upcoming League One fixtures using
      the decimal odds format:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Sunderland to win is priced at 1.53 with SkyBet whilst Bristol Rovers are
      available at 3.10 with BetVictor. By strategically adjusting your stakes
      you can guarantee a profit:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      <li>£66.95 stake * 1.53 = £102.43</li>
      <li>£33.05 stake * 3.10 = £102.46</li>
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This means your outlay is a combined £100 with a minimum return of
      £102.43; a near 2.5% return on investment. It doesn’t sound much but it’s
      a banker for profitable returns whilst you will also find more appealing
      bets as you explore opportunities. A 2.5% return for an afternoon’s work
      is also somewhat higher than a bank would pay.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      5. Matched betting
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Matched betting guarantees you a profit. Interested? I thought so. So how
      does it work? You’ll probably be well aware of all the free bet offers
      advertised by the many bookmakers. Well, matched betting only works when a
      free bet is available.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      First things first, you need to find a free bet – most bookies offer these
      on sign up. Then it’s a case of finding a suitable event to wager on;
      you’ll need something that doesn’t have a clear favourite. It’s then a
      case of using your free bet to back a winner whilst utilising a betting
      exchange website to ‘lay’ against the team you’ve backed. A lay bet is
      simply saying I think team X will not win thus covering a loss and draw.
      You now have all three outcomes covered.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Of course, you need to calculate the relevant stake to lay whilst your
      amount at risk – called the lay liability – is higher than the stake as it
      needs to cover potential losses because of how betting exchanges work.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Don’t worry though because profit is guaranteed! Let’s look at an example:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Today, Kilmarnock host Dundee United. Your free bet, which in this
      instance will be via SkyBet, is to back the home side i.e. I think
      Kilmarnock will win. The odds are 2.30. You can lay the bet i.e. I think
      Kilmarnock will fail to win with Smarkets at 2.42.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      £10 free bet stake * 2.30 = £23 – £10 as the stake isn’t returned = £13
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Lay £5.42 * 2.42 = £13.12 (your liability is £7.70, the difference between
      £13.12 and £5.42, which is the backers stake).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If your ‘back’ bet wins, you make £13.00 profit from SkyBet but lose £7.70
      on the Smarkets lay bet i.e. you’ve made £5.30 profit. If, however,
      Kilmarnock lose or draw then you win nothing on the SkyBet side but scoop
      your profit from Smarkets at £5.42 (minus a small commission).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The only other thing to consider is that most free bets require you to
      place a qualifying bet. Follow the same back and lay process as above and
      you will make a very minimal loss – usually pence – which will be more
      than covered in the second bet.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      4. Price boost exploitation
    </Typography>
    <Grid item>
      <ZoomImage
        style={{
          marginBottom: "10px",
          maxWidth: "100%",
          width: "100%",
          verticalAlign: "middle",
        }}
        src={
          "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rTRip6uiSPBvBNbJzSIpZw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/98abf5e3da3dc7389567b331612aa529/204633360/BIG-BETS-MPNOTOR-SPORTS-2-football-in-middle.jpg"
        }
        alt="blog"
      />
    </Grid>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Nearly every online bookmaker offers their customers enhanced odds on a
      daily basis. 99% of punters who take the bet do exactly that, they gamble
      hoping to win at the increased price. The 1% that remains know how to
      exploit these offers for positive return. We know that different bookies
      price events in different ways, which can present opportunities of its own
      where you can cover all outcomes for a win. These bets are not risk free
      though with accounts likely to be restricted and, potentially, closed.
      Price boosts can sometimes present the same possibilities but without the
      risk of account implications. The reason being that bookies want you to
      take their boosted odds.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The method to this strategy is to place a ‘back’ bet on the boosted odds
      and then headelsewhere to cover the other possible outcomes; typically,
      this will be done via betting exchanges and, specifically, using a lay
      bet. With the exception of odds moving and liquidity issues, this strategy
      is a banker; returns are generally smaller though.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      3. Lay betting strategies
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      We’ve just touched on lay bets in the above. Essentially, they are just a
      way of saying ‘that won’t happen’ rather than the traditional betting
      approach of ‘this will happen’. The logic to a lay bet does present
      opportunity though and it’s something plenty of bettors do. We’ll talk
      about two examples of how to use lay betting as a strategy.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The first is focussed on laying correct scores. It’s well known that
      predicting the exact score line of a football match is one of the hardest
      bets to win. With that nugget planted firmly in your mind, lay bets allow
      you to say ‘it won’t be that score’. Of course, there are plenty of score
      possibilities in any given match too meaning you can have several lay bets
      placed at once. The only way you lose is when one of the scores you lay
      actually washes in as the correct score.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The second of the lay football trading strategies we look at focuses on
      targeting specific in-play games. First of all, you’ll be looking for
      matches where you have a heavy favourite (cup matches can work well). The
      prospect of laying against a League Two side playing, for example, Man
      City is far from exciting. Your odds would be atrocious. If the underdog
      happens to take the lead though those odds start to improve. After all, it
      becomes like a handicap market. You now have the option to lay against the
      underdog with the idea that a significantly stronger team will come back.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Hopefully, we’ve covered the logic of a ‘lay bet’ in the above section
      regarding matched betting because you’ll be using it again here. Price
      boost exploitation is similar to arbitrage betting and matched betting –
      but it has two huge things in it’s favour over those. Where matched
      betting is concerned, you’re reliant on having free bets – that’s not the
      case here meaning nor is the qualifying bet. With arbitrage bets, you’re
      relying on an abnormally weighted set of odds on offer from a bookmaker –
      with price boosts, the bookie is deliberately giving you this edge whilst
      risk of being ‘gubbed’ (having your account restricted) is virtually zero.
      Why would a bookie do that? Plain and simply because most people won’t
      exploit the opportunity it creates and instead will just wager additional
      funds in a good old fashioned gamble.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      So, in ordinary circumstances, prices on offer from bookmakers won’t vary
      massively – although there is some opportunity on offer as mentioned
      earlier – because across the board bookmakers don’t want to create an
      industry that can be fiddled. Price boosts, however, are intended to pull
      in new money and are only on handpicked events meaning the industry will
      remain in a healthy position. For people in the know, it’s time to get
      winning. This example explains how it is done:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In the opening Premier League fixtures, Everton travel to face Tottenham
      with a current price of 4.0 to win with SkyBet. Let’s fast forward a
      couple of weeks and imagine they’re boosted to 5.0. You can lay against an
      Everton win i.e. Spurs to win or draw with the Betfair Exchange at 4.5.
      You’re now into guaranteed profit territory:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>£20 stake on the price boost * 5.0 = £100</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Lay £22.32 * 4.5 = £100.44 (your liability is £78.12)
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If your ‘back’ bet wins, you make £20 profit from SkyBet but lose £78.12
      on the lay bet i.e. you’ve made £1.88 profit. If, however, Everton fail to
      win then you win nothing on the SkyBet side but scoop your profit from
      your lay bet giving you £1.87 profit after a 2% commission.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Again, like the Arbitrage bets, the returns aren’t always colossal but
      price boosts are available several times a day meaning profits can soon
      mount up with a lot of those who follow this method making a well north of
      £100 per week.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      2. Player trading platforms
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The nextstop on our tour of the best football trading strategies comes
      with somewhat of a twist; player trading platforms. Football Index were
      the first to market with this sort of ‘gambling meets fantasy football’
      model; now though sites like Footstock and Sorare have also emerged in a
      similar space. What are they?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Well the specifics associated to each one depends on what site you look at
      because they are all different. The manner of making money is similar
      though. In really simplistic terms, player trading platforms allow you to
      buy real life footballers (in a virtual world) who are then rated based on
      their actual performances in actual games through data like that captured
      by Opta. Performance can be rewarded through the payment of dividends or
      prizes and, as with stock markets, capital appreciation i.e. buy low, sell
      high is the end game.

    <Typography paragraph>
      Here we look at a trading strategy that was developed to profit in the
      financial world. Its transition to football betting works seamlessly and,
      as football trading strategies go, it’s probably the one with the best
      grounding to help you build sustainable profit. It will take some getting
      used to though. The main reason for this is because the Kelly Criterion
      method is all about probability and bankroll management; this means you’ll
      need to master a few mathematical calculations before you can really set
      about using it. We realise that might not be uber appealing to a lot of
      people but the flip side is that you can apply the strategy to pretty much
      any event you want.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The starting place for the Kelly Criterion strategy is locating an event
      you’d like to bet on; let’s call it a straight forward match result bet.
      Initially, there are two pieces of information you will need; the first is
      given to you by the bookmaker – the odds. The second will take a bit more
      effort; you need to work out the actual probability. There are a lot of
      ways to do this so we won’t tread that path right now. These two elements
      form the basis of the first mathematical calculation, which shows the
      value of a bet.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If the value of the first calculation is negative then you do not bet on
      the event. If the value is positive then you can move on to the second
      calculation, which determines how much money you should look to stake. Of
      course, everyone will have different bankrolls and therefore your answer
      will be expressed as a percentage. This will give you a third and final
      calculation to establish how much cash you need to stake.

    <Typography paragraph>
      For the purposes of our calculation, we’re using the SkyBet odds of 2.60
      for Burnley to win at home against Fulham. We’ll be using a probability of
      42% and a bankroll of £500.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>The first calculation:</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The structure of the calculation is ‘(Probability as a decimal * decimal
      Odds )-1 = Value‘
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      With our specific selection it is ‘(0.42 * 2.60)-1 = 0.092 i.e. 9.2%
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      As this is a positive number we move on to calculation two.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>The second calculation:</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The structure of the calculation is ‘Answer of calculation 1 in decimal
      form/ (odds – 1) = Stake percentage’

    <Typography paragraph>
      With our specific selection it is ‘£500 * 5.75% = £28.75’

      The Martingale Method
    </Typography>
    <Grid item>
      <ZoomImage
        style={{
          marginBottom: "10px",
          maxWidth: "100%",
          width: "100%",
          verticalAlign: "middle",

      />
    </Grid>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The Martingale strategy was originally born in the casino world. It has
      slowly been adopted into sport. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense
      as to how you can profit following the process. It works. The practice
      will even see you thrown out of a casino. It does, however, come with a
      substantial warning; out of all the football betting strategies we mention
      this one comes with the highest risks because of the need for a big
      starting bankroll and the fact you can theoretically max out the staking
      limits bookies put in place.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The casino game the Martingale method was developed around is roulette.
      You pick a colour (red or black) and constantly double your stake until
      you win and, because the odds are evens i.e. 1/1, you’ll always end up
      with a profit equal to your starting stake. It’s a similar thought process
      in football. You find a bet where the odds are greater than or equal to
      evens and bet time and time again until it comes in, each time doubling
      your stake. Logically sound.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The trouble is, even starting with a modest stake of £1, if you run
      through 10 losses in a row you need to find some big money – by most
      people standards. Why? Well, £1 becomes £2, £2 becomes £4 and before you
      know it the stake for bet number 10 is £512 and you’ve already spent £511
      over the past nine bets. That’s over a grand and even if you win bet 10,
      you’re only gaining £1 profit. It might take a good week to walk through
      this process too.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      There you have it, our overview of some of the football betting strategies
      that could help transform the way you bet. Good Luck.

      How to mine cryptocurrency on Android phones and PC? Lots of people ask me

      The first section of this post is all about getting started with crypto

    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      1. Select a Cryptocurrency
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Cryptocurrencies take ages to get mined. That's why you need to select a
      currency that is easy to mine. And I believe Monero doesn't require tons
      of hash rate, which means mining Monero is comparatively easy.

      If you want to start crypto mining on your Android phone, you must confirm
      if your mining software works with a CPU. Nanopool confirms that the
      Monero coin works on the Random X algorithm.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      And if we go to NanoMiner's Algorithms section, you'll know that the
      Random X algorithm works with CPU quite easily. It means Monero (XMR)
      coins are a perfect choice for mining on Android phones and PC. Let's
      start mining XMR right now.

      Now you need to confirm the OS on which you want to start mining Monero.

      Start Mining Cryptocurrency on Your Android Phone
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      To start mining cryptocurrency on your Android phone, you need to install
      an Android miner. For that, choose Termux or install MinerGate. The latter
      has been banned from PlayStore for violating Google's policies. But you
      can still install it without worrying.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      After you install Termux, enter these commands to start mining:
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      <li>pkg install upgrade</li>
      <li> apt install git</li>
      <li> apt install wget</li>
      <li> apt install proot</li>
      <li>termux-setup-storage</li>
      <li> git clone https://github.com/neo-oli/termux-ubuntu</li>
      <li> cd termux-ubuntu</li>
      <li>chmod +x ubuntu.sh (optional)</li>
      <li> sh.ubuntu.sh (optional)</li>
      <li>./start-ubuntu.sh (optional)</li>
      <li> apt update</li>
      <li> apt upgrade</li>
      <li> git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig</li>
      <li> cd xmrig</li>
      <li> mkdir build </li>
      <li>cd build</li>
      <li>cmake-dwith_wloc=off_</li>
      <li> make</li>

    <Typography paragraph>
      After that, you must have started mining Monero on your Android phone. Now

      Can I mine cryptocurrency on my smartphone?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      There is no doubt that cryptocurrencies need a huge amount of processing
      power. Google and Apple don't allow or help mining on Android and iOS
      phones. But you can still start mining on your smartphone. The video on my
      YouTube channel and this post demonstrate how it happens.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Why did Google ban crypto mining apps?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Crypto mining means the increased pressure on your phone's processor. It
      also drains your phone's battery faster than ever. Smartphone companies
      don't want your phones to bear the extra burden. That may be the reason
      for Google's ban on crypto mining apps.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      What are the best cryptocurrency mining apps for Android?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      With recent technological advancements, many crypto mining apps for
      Android have been rolling. Some of the top mining apps include CryptoTab,
      NiceHash, MinerGate, SparkPool, Turmex, and many more.

      Can Bitcoin be mined on Android?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      There are many apps for crypto mining on your smartphone. Android is a
      suitable OS for crypto mining. So yes, Bitcoin can be mined on Android
      phones, but it will take ages. I have tried mining BTC on my Android
      phone. Watch this video to learn how you can do the same.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Which cryptocurrency is the cheapest to mine on the phone?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Monero and Revencoin are two of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to mine on
      your phone. And that's why I have tried mining Monero for this tutorial on
      how to mine crypto on an Android phone. It comparatively requires less
      hash rate than most cryptocurrencies.

      Summarizing Crypto Mining on Android Phones
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Thanks to the recent advancements in the crypto-industry, you can mine any
      cryptocurrency on your Android phone now. I have detailed my process of
      crypto mining on PC and phone as well.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      Let me quickly summarize it for you.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      <li>Select a cryptocurrency (I've chosen Monero)</li>
      <li>Create a crypto wallet (using GUI Wallet by GetMonero)</li>
      <li>Download the mining rig (XMRig in my case)</li>
      <li>Install ‘termux' app on your phone</li>
      <li>Enter commands given above</li>
      <li>Start crypto mining on Android</li>
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      And you can choose from a variety of crypto mining apps for Android, from
      MinerGate to NicheHas. In this experience, I have mined 0.000005 Monero.
      But it depends on your device's hash rate and many other factors as well.

      10 Ways Scammers are Stealing Your Money Online
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      1. Phishing stunts.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This is one of the most settled, and by and large unavoidable, deceives
      out there. Honestly, GoDaddy customers are at this point dealing with a
      phishing stunt.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Phishing stunts are when cybercriminals present noxious programming onto
      your contraption, after you click on an association that you got in an
      email or online media message, to trick you into sharing login
      accreditations to your monetary equilibrium, casual local area, work
      record, or conveyed stockpiling provider. They may even have the choice to
      take your medical care or favored client credits!
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      2. Free fundamental arrangement.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      We've all gone over those free one-month fundamentals for an astounding
      thing like a wellbeing improvement plan. The catch? You essentially need
      to pay for postage. Furthermore, that is just a minimal expense of $5,95!
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Sadly, there's the fine print that you'll generally not be able to examine
      – reasonable because it's in a concealing that blends out of spotlight.
      This fine print communicates that you'll be expected to pay expensive
      month to month charges. Suddenly, that $5.95 for postage is costing you
      $99 every month after the free fundamental failures.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      3. For friendship
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      With an impressive proportion of people looking for Mr. or Mrs. directly
      on the web, it lamentably looks good that swindlers would use this as an
      opportunity to deceive confused people. As the Federal Trade Commission
      raises, these cleared out individuals "make fake electronic profiles using
      photos of others — even taken pictures of certifiable military workforce."
      They then, articulate their worship and a short time later describe to you
      a heartbreaking record which can be gotten comfortable the occasion that
      you send them cash.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      As a rule they'll demand that you set-up another standard and have you
      move cash into the new record. Despite the way that, if you watch Catfish,
      a piece of these people simply have your wire the cash to a spot like
      Western Union.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      4. "A buddy has sent you an E-Card."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This is another email stunt that has been around for a serious long time.
      Essentially, you get an E-Card in your email inbox that emits an
      impression of being from a sidekick or relative. You open the card, which
      achieves noxious writing computer programs being downloaded and presented
      on your functioning structure. Finally, this item will begin sharing
      private data and money related information to a phony server that is being
      compelled by advanced convicts.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      5. The Wifi Danger Zone.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      We've been in a public space, similar to a café or air terminal, and
      eagerly sign into the local Wi-Fi zone. The login page takes after a free
      assistance or a remuneration organization like Boingo Wireless, and since
      it has every one of the reserves of being great overall, you join the
      association.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      On occasion, there's a nearby criminal who is truly burrowing your PC for
      ebank, Mastercard, and other mystery key information. This is the
      explanation regtech is so critical for financial foundations to complete.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      6. It's the "ridiculous" offer.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Did you essentially get a phenomenal proposition on the latest iPhone?
      What might be said about another Visa offer with a remarkable advance
      expense?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Since you would rather not miss this once-in-lifetime deal, you make the
      purchase or recognize the suggestion. Clearly, this was all of the a ploy
      to take your financial information.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Constantly recall. In the event that it's ridiculous, it in all
      probability is.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      7. Your Computer is Infected!
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Here is one more oldie but a goodie. You're web doing your thing and
      subsequently a popup appears from a genuine sounding antivirus programming
      program advised you that your PC is corrupted and you truly needed to
      download the program. Concerned, you click on the association and by and
      by malignant writing computer programs is really taking a look at your PC
      for login information.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In various circumstances, the "item" finds a contamination and pledges to
      kill it for a cost. Clearly, this will not at any point happen.
      Nevertheless, the advanced criminal as of now has your charge card
      information.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      8. Pulling at your heart strings.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      There are some entirely abominable people out there who will ensure that
      they're from an establishment and contending for your monetary help.
      Considerably more shocking, they'll exploit progressing calamitous
      occasions or events so they stunt seems certified – while moreover pulling
      at your heart strings – to get your cash and banking information.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      9. Ransomware.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "Ransomware, which is a sort of malware, works by either holding your
      entire PC detainee or by hindering permission to every one of your
      archives by scrambling them," makes Cadie Thompson in Business Insider.
      "An individual corrupted with ransomware is normally mentioned (through a
      spring up window) to pay anything from a few hundred several thousand
      dollars to get the way of opening their mixed data."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      What's agitating about ransomware is that it's progressing, and spreading.
      This is because cybercriminals are "using the most present day
      cryptography to encode taken records and are getting extraordinary at
      making their risky associations and downloads give off an impression of
      being absolutely innocuous."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      For example, a cybercriminal could be mimicking an assistance association
      and is finding a way ways to unwind your organization aside from in the
      event that you complete the joined design.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      10. That isn't really your Facebook buddy.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Since basically everyone has a Facebook account, it's not really
      astonishing that hoodlums would use the casual local area for their
      benefit
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This stunt is fundamental. You get a buddy interest from someone that you
      may or not know. Regardless, you have some common sidekicks. Along these
      lines, you recognize their sales. As of now this singular methodologies
      your various buddies, photographs, and information like your recreation
      exercises, where you work, and what school you participate. They then,
      make a fake record where they carry on like you.
    </Typography>
    This singular then, asks your Facebook allies for money or open them to
    malware after "you" demand that they click on an association with watch an
    interesting video or take an audit.
    <Typography paragraph>The best strategy to Avoid Online Scams</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Regardless in the event that it's an email stunt, relational cooperation
      stunt, or caution system, there are different methods of getting yourself.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Use trustworthiness. If you see an email address, eradicate the message,
      and never open the message regardless.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Never maintain comparative mystery state across various records
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      If a plan or arrangement looks ridiculous, it is.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Consider using security endeavors like two-factor confirmation. This is
      especially critical while dealing with a convenient wallet or ePayment.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>

      trained professionals. Moreover, make sure to slow down you PC and
      disengage it from your association so it doesn't spread to various
      contraptions.
