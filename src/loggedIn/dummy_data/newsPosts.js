      Mark Zuckerberg wants to be known for building the metaverse
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Facebook is planning to change its company name next week to reflect its
      focus on building the metaverse, according to a source with direct
      knowledge of the matter.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at
      the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil
      sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more
      than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely
      position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent
      company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A
      spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.

    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      FACEBOOK INTENDS TO TRANSITION TO “BEING A METAVERSE COMPANY”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Facebook already has more than 10,000 employees building consumer hardware
      like AR glasses that Zuckerberg believes will eventually be as ubiquitous
      as smartphones. In July, he told The Verge that, over the next several
      years, “we will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily
      being a social media company to being a metaverse company.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      A rebrand could also serve to further separate the futuristic work
      Zuckerberg is focused on from the intense scrutiny Facebook is currently
      under for the way its social platform operates today. A former employee
      turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, recently leaked a trove of damning
      internal documents to The Wall Street Journal and testified about them
      before Congress. Antitrust regulators in the US and elsewhere are trying
      to break the company up, and public trust in how Facebook does business is
      falling.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Facebook isn’t the first well-known tech company to change its company
      name as its ambitions expand. In 2015, Google reorganized entirely under a
      holding company called Alphabet, partly to signal that it was no longer
      just a search engine, but a sprawling conglomerate with companies making
      driverless cars and health tech. And Snapchat rebranded to Snap Inc. in
      2016, the same year it started calling itself a “camera company” and
      debuted its first pair of Spectacles camera glasses.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      I’m told that the new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret
      within its walls and not known widely, even among its full senior
      leadership. A possible name could have something to do with Horizon, the
      name of the still-unreleased VR version of Facebook-meets-Roblox that the
      company has been developing for the past few years. The name of that app
      was recently tweaked to Horizon Worlds shortly after Facebook demoed a
      version for workplace collaboration called Horizon Workrooms.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      FACEBOOK HAS BEEN LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A BRANDING CHANGE
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Aside from Zuckerberg’s comments, Facebook has been steadily laying the
      groundwork for a greater focus on the next generation of technology. This
      past summer it set up a dedicated metaverse team. More recently, it
      announced that the head of AR and VR, Andrew Bosworth, will be promoted to
      chief technology officer. And just a couple of days ago Facebook announced
      plans to hire 10,000 more employees to work on the metaverse in Europe.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The metaverse is “going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just
      going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet
      evolves after the mobile internet,” Zuckerberg told The Verge’s Casey
      Newton this summer. “And I think it’s going to be the next big chapter for
      our company too, really doubling down in this area.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Complicating matters is that, while Facebook has been heavily promoting
      the idea of the metaverse in recent weeks, it’s still not a concept that’s
      widely understood. The term was coined originally by sci-fi novelist Neal
      Stephenson to describe a virtual world people escape to from a dystopian,
      real world. Now it’s being adopted by one of the world’s largest and most
      controversial companies — and it’ll have to explain why its own virtual
      world is worth diving into.

      Hours viewed ‘is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our
      titles’
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Netflix will change the public-facing metrics it uses to rank the most
      popular titles on its streaming service, the company announced Tuesday.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In the past, the company has ranked titles based on the completion of at
      least the first two minutes of a film or TV show in its first 28 days on
      the service. More recently, however, the company has released rankings
      based on the total number of hours a movie or series is viewed — a metric
      it will shift to moving forward beginning later this year, the company
      said in a letter to shareholders.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      “There is some difference in rankings [...] but we think engagement as
      measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall
      success of our titles and member satisfaction,” the company said. “It also
      matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to
      rewatching.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
      NETFLIX SAYS HOURS VIEWED “IS A SLIGHTLY BETTER INDICATOR OF THE OVERALL
      SUCCESS OF OUR TITLES”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The change will not only shift one of its key public ranking systems from
      viewers to hours viewed but should, in theory, make its rankings a little
      easier to understand. While the company does track things like completion
      of its titles internally, the 2-minute metric was confusing and had the
      potential to misrepresent the true success of a series or film (for
      example, if an account holder watched only the first two minutes but then
      bailed).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Additionally, the company said, “we will start to release title metrics
      more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the
      industry can better measure success in the streaming world.” Transparency
      around streaming figures — and the accuracy with which services track
      their titles — has been called for by industry figures who say that
      streaming services aren’t forthright about success metrics, complicating
      everything from cast and crew payouts to contract negotiations.

      Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos last month at
      CodeCon shared rankings of Netflix’s top titles based on both the 2-minute
      metric and the hours watched metric, and a side-by-side comparison showed
      that — while overlap was certainly visible — the different metrics changed
      the title rankings noticeably.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      What’s certain is that by many of its metrics, its Korean drama Squid Game
      has been a massive success on the platform. Citing internal documents,
      Bloomberg reported last week that the company estimated “89% of people who
      started the show watched at least 75 minutes (more than one episode), and
      66% of viewers, or 87 million people, have finished the series in the
      first 23 days.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Last week, the company announced the series had become its biggest ever
      series at launch. In its shareholders letter on Tuesday, the company
      revealed that a “mind-boggling” 142 million households globally had tuned
      into the show, based on its 2-minute metric.

      camera (which bins images down to 12.5-megapixels during processing). The

      GOOGLE’S NEW PHONES ARE POWERED BY ITS TENSOR PROCESSOR

      Much of Google’s event focused on the Google-designed Tensor processor
      that powers the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google showed off how the machine
      learning prowess of its chip would be able to help with tasks like voice
      recognition, making photos less blurry (and even automatically erasing
      unwanted people from the background), and real-time captions and
      translation. Outside of ML, Google says that it should be competitive with
      Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processors when it comes to overall CPU and
      GPU performance.

      Vojin Kusic, 72, says the home's front door also rotates so if his wife
      "spots unwanted guests heading our way, she can spin the house and make
      them turn away.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      SRBAC, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — It’s not exactly on par with India’s Taj
      Mahal, but a family house in a small town in northern Bosnia is in its own
      way a monument to love.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The house in Srbac was designed and built by 72-year-old Vojin Kusic. With
      a green facade and red metal roof, it can rotate a full circle to satisfy
      his wife Ljubica’s shifting desires as to what she would like to see when
      she looks out of its windows.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      “After I reached an advanced age and after my children took over the
      family business, I finally had enough time to task myself with granting my
      wife her wish” to be able to change the position of rooms in her house
      whenever she wants, Kusic said.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Many years ago when they married, Kusic had built another, typical house
      for himself and his wife in which they raised their three children. At the
      time, his wife wanted their bedrooms to face the sun, so they did. But
      this meant their living room faced away from the road. After a while, he
      says his wife complained that “she could not see people entering our front
      yard” and Kusic had to remodel everything.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      “I had to tear down the wall between our two bedrooms to turn them into a
      living room and move all (electrical) installations. It was a very
      demanding task, it took a lot from me, but I did what she wanted,” he
      said.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Then six years ago, the only one of Kusic’s three children not to fly the
      nest, a son, got married and his parents decided to let him live on the
      top floor of their family house while they moved to the ground floor.
    </Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
      “Once again, this time on the ground floor, I had to start tearing down
      some walls, at which point, to not wait for her to change her mind again,
      I decided to build a new, rotating house so that she can spin it as she
      pleases,” Kusic said.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Kusic, who did not have a chance to go to college, designed and built his
      rotating house by himself, using electric motors and the wheels of an old
      military transport vehicle.

      Egyptian man arrested after broadcasting face during robbery
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Egyptian social media users have hailed a man who inadvertently broadcast
      his face to thousands of people while stealing a journalist's phone as
      "the coolest thief in Egypt".
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Mahmoud Ragheb, a reporter for the news site Youm7, was livestreaming a
      report on social media when the thief drove by on a motorbike and seized
      his phone.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The broadcast then revealed the young thief's face as he sped away from
      the scene casually smoking a cigarette.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>Police have since announced his arrest.</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      According to Youm7, the incident happened on a bridge in Egypt's
      fourth-largest city, Shubra Al-Khaimah, where Mr Ragheb was reporting on
      the after-effects of a 6.2-magnitude earthquake that rattled parts of
      Egypt.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Mr Ragheb was filming the bridge when his phone was grabbed roughly from
      his hands by the unnamed thief. Once the camera had stopped shaking it
      revealed the face of a young man smoking a cigarette and checking slightly
      nervously behind him to see if anyone was in pursuit.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      However, there was little sympathy for the intrepid reporter's plight,
      with most social media users focussing on the thief's relaxed demeanour as
      he snatched the phone and continued to pull on his cigarette as he made
      his escape.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      One user commented that they had "died from laughter," while another
      questioned why the man had bothered looking behind him while "the whole
      world is watching you".
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      More than 20,000 people were watching the livestream when the theft took
      place and according to figures on Facebook, the video has since racked up
      more than 6.2 million views and 45,000 comments in a little over 24 hours.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Sadly for the thief, broadcasting his face in this way made it relatively
      easy for authorities to track him down. The Ministry of the Interior
      announced last night that it has detained him.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In a statement, the ministry said that the man is "jobless" and that he
      has since sold the stolen mobile to a trader.

      The Jetsons.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The 1960s show depicted a family living in a futuristic metropolis where
      commuters headed to work in cars that soared through the air.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Two decades into the 21st Century, and the science fiction dreams of the
      creators of The Jetsons are closer than ever to becoming a reality.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      With the likes of Uber and Boeing developing eVTOL (electric vertical
      take-off and landing) flying taxis, one report predicts that by 2040 there
      will be 430,000 such vehicles in operation around the world.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      This comes as delivery drones are also being increasingly developed and
      tested, with the global market for these tipped to be worth $5.6bn (£4bn)
      by 2028, according to one estimate.

      Did the The Jetsons correctly predict the future?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      To handle the demands of a future, in which drones and flying taxis (think
      large, multi-propeller drones) share airspace over busy conurbations,
      proponents of the technologies say cities will need to build lots of
      mini-airports, dubbed "skyports".
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      These mini airports will be needed so that the taxis can land in the spots
      where people want to go.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      California-based firm, Joby Aviation, is at the forefront of developing
      flying taxis, having now carried out more than 1,000 test flights of its
      eVTOL craft.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      It hopes to get approval from US regulator, the Federal Aviation
      Administration (FAA), to begin commercial operations in 2024.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Joby's piloted vehicle can carry four passengers, travel at up to 200 mph
      (322 km/ph), and has a range of more than 150 miles (241km).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "We envisage offering our aerial ride-sharing service from locations near
      to where people live, work and want to go," says Oliver Walker-Jones, a
      spokesperson for Joby.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "We are working closely with cities to ensure our service connects to
      other modes of transit, co-locating skyports with train stations, airports
      and other hubs."

      Joby's electric-powered flying taxi looks like a helicopter crossed with a
      fixed-wing aeroplane
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Joby has already partnered with US parking firm Reef Techology with the
      aim of turning the roofs of some of its carparks into skyports. And it has
      signed a similar deal with property business Related Companies, New York's
      largest landlord.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "With these partners, we aim to build out skyports in initial launch
      markets that offer attractive savings on routes with high existing demand
      and frustrating levels of congestion on the ground," adds Mr Walker-Jones.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      While a network of skyports may seem far-fetched, the concept is already
      receiving considerable positive attention from a number of US city
      administrations.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Houston, Los Angeles, and Orlando have already announced plans to
      establish infrastructure for flying taxis and other similar vehicles.

      A number of US cities see flying taxis as a way to help tackle road
      congestion
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In the UK, plans to build the country's first skyport in Coventry near the
      city's rugby and football stadium have the backing of the British
      government.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Seeking to become the world's first operational hub for air taxis and
      cargo drones, it is being designed by a Hyundai-backed UK company called
      Urban Air Port (the firm has registered the name as a trademark).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Billed as the "world's smallest airport", the firm hopes that the
      zero-emissions facility will be replicated around the globe to cut both
      road congestion and air pollution from cars and lorries.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "Existing airports around the world are huge, and carbon hungry, with
      1.2km runways," says Urban Air Port founder and executive chairman Ricky
      Sandhu. "That's because of the technology and how the aircraft take off

      to support those."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Mr Sadhu adds that the initial site in Coventry - which is expected to
      become open in early 2022 - will serve as a "logistics demonstration."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The project's designers believe that the concept will show how a network
      of small urban mobility hubs can be rapidly set up in cities of various
      sizes.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "Our goal is to show that the turnaround time can be absolutely minimal,
      so that with a very small footprint, you can get high-capacity
      infrastructure that can support the vehicles," Mr Sadhu said.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Experts, however, point to several challenges that stand in the way of
      flying taxis and skyports really taking off.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "Whether and when we reach a point reminiscent of the Jetsons will depend
      on how the industry handles a number of key hurdles," says Jennifer
      Richter, a Washington-DC based lawyer who specialises in the law
      surrounding drones and air taxis.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "These include public acceptance, high-volume manufacturing, digital,
      power and physical infrastructure investment, and the development of a
      highly-automated air traffic management system."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Michael Taylor, a travel and technology expert at US business research
      group JD Power, says the main challenges are regulatory hurdles and air
      traffic control systems.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "Imagine the regulation of air traffic routes, and then multiply that by a
      million," he says.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "It's likely to start by establishing standard drone, or air taxi routes.
      Rules will be set, kinks worked out, and standards applied universally to
      minimise incidents."
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Regarding regulatory hurdles, the biggest barrier is that flying taxis
      have yet to be given authorisation to fly commercially by the relevant
      authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US,
      or the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Both of these are, however, continuing to study the issue - the safety of
      such vehicles, and how authorisation can be formulated and subsequently
      monitored. At the CAA this work is being done by a specific innovation
      team.

    <Typography paragraph>
      Aaron Belbasis, an expert in emerging technology at engineering and design
      firm Aurecon, says that the health and safety issues are paramount.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      He points out that with more motorised vehicles in the air it is a
      statistical probability that more accidents will occur, adding that if a
      flying taxi fell in an uncontrolled way it "could amount to a descent with
      as much aerodynamic finesse as a rock, posing great danger to all
      on-board, and anyone or anything in the direct parabolic vicinity of the
      vehicle".
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Ricky Sadhu says his main concern is that investment in skyports and other
      infrastructure may lack behind investment in the eVTOL vehicles
      themselves.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "I'm less concerned about regulation. What we're seeing is evolving
      quickly," he says.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Mr Sadhu says that despite the challenges, there is already enormous
      demand and interest in skyports from cities across the US, Europe and
      Asia.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "We're aiming to see 200 Urban Air Ports deployed within the next five
      years, globally," Mr Sadhu added. "But we think that's conservative,
      because big cities will need significantly more."

      It has been quite a year for Jesse Lingard.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      He started it firmly out of the picture at Manchester United but a loan
      spell at West Ham reignited his form and now he's providing assists for
      Cristiano Ronaldo and finding himself a wanted man in the Premier League
      again.
    </Typography>

      A return to the Hammers had appeared to be an option over the summer while
      Newcastle, fresh from their recent big-money takeover, are thought to be
      contemplating a move for the forward in January's transfer window.

      Jesse Lingard, centre, won player and goal of the month while at West Ham
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Ask Lingard himself and he will probably say that moving to West Ham in
      the January transfer window was the best move he could have made.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The 28-year-old had made just three appearances for Manchester United last
      season - all in cup competitions - but at the Hammers he quickly became an
      integral player for a side battling for the Champions League spots.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Lingard scored an impressive nine goals from February onwards during his
      16-game spell at David Moyes' side, also chipping in with five assists.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      But despite that excellent form it still appeared difficult to see a
      future for him on his return to Manchester United, particularly with Bruno
      Fernandes playing in his favoured position and the summer arrivals of
      Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho adding to the competition for places.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      His cause was seemingly not helped with a costly mistake against Young
      Boys in last month's opening Champions League group stage match; his poor
      back pass handing the Swiss side an injury-time winner.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      But that has proven to be a blip in an otherwise good run of form, albeit
      as something of a super-sub.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Four of his last six appearances for Manchester United have been off the
      bench and during that time he has scored twice and set up one goal -
      Ronaldo's last-minute winner against Villareal in their second Champions
      League game.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, someone who as a player also earned the
      reputation as a super-sub, Lingard clearly has a role to play at the Red
      Devils.

      recently rejected a new contract and expressed concerns about how much
      game time he is going to get.

    <Typography paragraph>
      At 28, Lingard is in his prime and arguably at the peak of his

      His resurgence, first at West Ham and latterly as a sub at United, has

      By his own admission, this season is a fresh start for Lingard.

      Solskjaer said before Saturday's defeat by Leicester City: "Jesse has had

    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Gus Poyet scored after just 27 seconds, triggering a Blue day for United
      in west London, with Chris Sutton, Jody Morris, another Poyet strike and a
      Henning Berg own goal completing the visitors’ humiliation after Nicky
      Butt’s dismissal.

      Fernando Torres ran riot, with Steven Gerrard, Fabio Aurelio and Andrea
      Dossena also on target and Nemanja Vidic dismissed for United, who
      survived the onslaught well enough to beat the Reds in the title race.

    <Typography paragraph>
      This was the first time United had conceded six goals at Old Trafford
      since 1930, their heaviest home defeat for 56 years triggered by doubles
      for Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko, as well as strike each by Sergio
      Aguero and David Silva.

    <Typography paragraph>
      United went in front courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes penalty inside the
      opening two minutes, but Anthony Martial’s dismissal was the signal for
      Son Heung-min and Harry Kane to score twice, while Tanguy Ndombele and
      Serge Aurier also netted as Jose Mourinho enjoyed a memorable return to
      his former club.

      It’s also got a new moderation tool for admins
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Facebook will start demoting all Groups content from people who have
      violated its policies elsewhere across the platform. The move is supposed
      to limit rulebreakers from reaching other people in a community, and it
      builds on existing policies that prevent them from posting, commenting, or
      inviting others.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      In a blog post, Facebook says it will also add a new “Flagged by Facebook”
      feature that shows group administrators content that’s been flagged for
      removal. The admins can choose to remove the content or to ask for a
      review if they believe it’s appropriate, with the goal of getting
      administrators involved before Facebook steps in and issues a strike that
      could affect the group itself.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Facebook has paid increasing attention to groups since the 2020 US
      presidential election, where they were used to spread false information
      about voting. It’s also facing increased scrutiny over extremism and other
      harmful content on the platform thanks to documents leaked by former
      Facebook employee Frances Haugen, who recently testified before Congress.
      Earlier this week, Facebook indicated that it’s also expecting a slew of
      new stories based on “thousands of pages of leaked documents.”
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      While the company characterized the upcoming reports as “an orchestrated
      ‘gotcha’ campaign,” it’s also promoted its efforts to reduce hateful or
      false content while offering greater transparency around moderation. A
      September update offered detail about content that it demoted as
      problematic but didn’t entirely remove, including posts by accounts that
      had violated its rules in the past.

      If you’re counting down the days until the holiday season commences, we’ve
      got good news. Netflix is due to add more than 100 titles in November,
      including a number of holiday-themed movies and series.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The 2021 Netflix holiday slate includes Hallmark-style romances like “A
      Castle for Christmas” (premiering Nov. 26) and family comedies including
      the British film “Father Christmas Is Back” (Nov. 7). And Vanessa Hudgens
      returns as multiple lookalike characters in the third installment in the
      “Princess Switch” series, “The Princess Switch 3: Romancing The Star”
      (Nov. 18).
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      For family-friendly fare, Michelle Obama’s “Waffles + Mochi” series
      returns on Nov. 23 for the special “Waffles + Mochi’s Holiday Feast.”
      Additionally, the winter-themed “Charlie’s Colorforms City: Snowy Stories”
      debuts on Nov. 30.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Beyond the holiday realm, the documentary sequel “Tiger King 2” is bound
      to get some buzz when it premieres on Nov. 17. The same goes for “The
      Harder They Fall” (Nov. 3) ― a new Western produced by Jay-Z starring
      Idris Elba, Regina King, Zazie Beetz and Jonathan Majors.
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      The action-comedy “Red Notice” (Nov. 12) also has an all-star cast,
      including Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. As for
      TV, if you’re a fan of “Big Mouth” and “Narcos: Mexico,” you’ll get new
      seasons to binge on Nov. 5.
